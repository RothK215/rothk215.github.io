    My name is Roth and I have a video game addiction. It started when I was 8 and I discovered Runescape for the first time.
    I eventually played long enough to develope a love for the RPG genre preferebly games taht takes place within the midevil era with mythicalk cratures and magic.
    I later moved on to Archlord, Maplestory, and currently Final Fantasy 14.
